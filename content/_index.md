# Infrastructure Monitoring với Custom Metrics và Dashboards

Welcome to my workshop on **Infrastructure Monitoring với Custom Metrics và Dashboards**.

In this workshop, we will dive into the core concepts of infrastructure monitoring and observability, exploring how to collect, analyze, and visualize system performance data implementing custom metrics collection and creating interactive dashboards. Then, we will construct an automated monitoring pipeline utilizing AWS services such as **Amazon CloudWatch**, **AWS CloudWatch Logs**, and **Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards** to ensure continuous visibility into our infrastructure health and performance.


#### Target Audience

This workshop is designed for beginners who are new to infrastructure monitoring and want to learn about observability, custom metrics collection, and dashboard creation using AWS monitoring services.
