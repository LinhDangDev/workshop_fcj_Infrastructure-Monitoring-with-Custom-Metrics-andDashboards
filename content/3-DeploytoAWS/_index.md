In this module, we'll deploy our application to AWS by setting up a complete containerized infrastructure. We'll provision an **Amazon ECS cluster** with all the necessary components including an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, an **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** database, and **AWS Secrets Manager** for secure credential management. We'll also build and push our application container images to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** for deployment. The following diagram illustrates the complete architecture we'll implement.

## Deployment Overview

This module covers the following key components and deployment steps:

### 1. **Set up RDS Database**
We'll provision an **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** instance to serve as our application's primary database. This managed database service will handle our application's data persistence needs with automatic backups, monitoring, and maintenance.

### 2. **Create Container Images**
We'll build Docker container images for our application components and push them to **Amazon ECR**. This private container registry will store our images securely and make them available for ECS deployment.

### 3. **Create ECS Cluster**
We'll set up an **Amazon ECS cluster** using Fargate launch type. This serverless container platform will manage our application containers without requiring us to provision or manage EC2 instances.

### 4. **Define Task Execution**
We'll create **ECS Task Definitions** that specify how our containers should run, including CPU and memory requirements, container images, environment variables, and security configurations.

### 5. **Implement Load Balancing**
We'll configure an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute incoming traffic across our ECS tasks, providing high availability and automatic scaling capabilities.

### 6. **Launch Service**
Finally, we'll create and launch **ECS Services** that ensure our application tasks are running, healthy, and properly registered with the load balancer.

## How the System Functions

Here's how the complete system will operate:

1. **Users access the application** by entering the ALB's DNS name into their browser.
2. The **ALB receives incoming traffic** and intelligently routes it across healthy tasks managed by our ECS cluster.
3. **ECS tasks running our application** connect to the PostgreSQL database (managed by Amazon RDS) to store user data and retrieve information.
4. **Database credentials are securely retrieved** from AWS Secrets Manager, ensuring sensitive information is never hardcoded.

## Task Creation Requirements

For ECS tasks to be successfully created and run, they must:

1. **Pull container images** from Amazon ECR that we'll build and push during this module.
2. **Retrieve database secrets** from AWS Secrets Manager containing the connection string and credentials.
3. **Apply database migrations** to ensure the database schema is up-to-date before serving traffic.

## Migration Strategy

Initially, to manage database migrations without concurrency issues, we'll configure our service to **run only one task** for the core application. This temporary setup **prevents multiple tasks from attempting to apply migrations simultaneously**. Later, in the CI/CD module, we'll refine this approach by moving the database migration step to the build phase of our pipeline, which provides a more robust solution for handling migrations and allows for multiple running tasks.

Each of these deployment steps will be covered in detail in the following sections, providing you with hands-on experience in building a production-ready containerized application
